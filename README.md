Building a robotic head using a party mask as a face

This project is to build a human-like head for a robot.
This head will be programmed for facial expressions, lip articulation, jaw movement and eye movement.
This head will be accessible via WiFi for any master program that would like to control it. 
(note, it will also be ascessible via direct link if preferred)

The main electronic components will be the following:

(2) STM-32 microcontrollers 
(2) micro SD card readers 
(1) ESP 8266 WiFi module 
(2) PCA9685 16 channel servo controllers.  
9G micro servos 
28BYJ-48 stepper motors 

This project is mainly concerned with the mechanical design of the face controlling servos. 

There will be a more detailed explanation of the mechanical design requirements soon to come.
